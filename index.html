    <h2>About W.B. Yeats</h2>
    <center><img src="Yeats.jpg" width="25%"></center>
    
    <br>He is an <b>Irish cultural nationalist</b>, who helped forge Irish cultural identity and inspired the poet-revolutionaries who led <u>the Easter rising</u> of 1916 against British rule--"men the English shot"("Man and the Echo")
    <br>In 1940, after Yeats died, <strong><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/t-s-eliot" target="_blank" title="About T.S. Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a></strong> declared him <u>"the greatest poet of our time."</u> <br>One key to Yeat's greatness is that <u>there are many different Yeatses.</u>

    <p style="margin-top:30px;">He is, as he said, one of the <u>“last Romantics,”</u> straining after dreams and visions, brooding on loss and unrequited desire. But he is also <u>a modern poet,</u> who harshly mocks idealism, nostalgia, and contemporary society, even affirming ruin and destruction: <i>“We that look on but laugh in tragic joy” (<a href="https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-gyres/" target="_blank" title="The Gyers">“The Gyres”</a></i>).</p>
    <p style="margin-top:30px;">He is <u>a literary traditionalist</u>, working within such ingerited genres as love poetry, the elegy, the self-elegy, the sonnet, and the occasional poem on public themes. But he is also <u>a restless innovator</u> who distupts generic conversations, breaking up the coherence of the sonnet, deidealizing the dead mourned in elegies, and bringing into public poems an intense personal ambivalence.</p>
