    <h3>Easter, 1916</h3>
    <h6>BY WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS</h6>
    <p>I have met them at close of day<br>   
    Coming with vivid faces<br>
    From counter or desk among grey<br>   
    Eighteenth-century houses.<br>
    I have passed with a nod of the head <br>  
    Or polite meaningless words,<br>   
    Or have lingered awhile and said <br>  
    Polite meaningless words,<br>
    And thought before I had done <br>  
    Of a mocking tale or a gibe<br>   
    To please a companion<br>
    Around the fire at the club,<br>   
    Being certain that they and I <br>  
    But lived where motley is worn: <br>  
    All changed, changed utterly:<br>   
    A terrible beauty is born.<br></p>
    
    <p>That woman's days were spent<br>   
    In ignorant good-will,<br>
    Her nights in argument<br>
    Until her voice grew shrill.<br>
    What voice more sweet than hers <br>  
    When, young and beautiful, <br>  
    She rode to harriers?<br>
    This man had kept a school<br>   
    And rode our wingèd horse;<br>   
    This other his helper and friend<br>   
    Was coming into his force;<br>
    He might have won fame in the end,<br>   
    So sensitive his nature seemed,<br>   
    So daring and sweet his thought.<br>
    This other man I had dreamed<br>
    A drunken, vainglorious lout.<br>
    He had done most bitter wrong<br>
    To some who are near my heart,<br>   
    Yet I number him in the song;<br>
    He, too, has resigned his part<br>
    In the casual comedy;<br>
    He, too, has been changed in his turn,<br>   
    Transformed utterly:<br>
    A terrible beauty is born.</p>
    
   <p> Hearts with one purpose alone<br>   
    Through summer and winter seem<br>   
    Enchanted to a stone<br>
    To trouble the living stream.<br>
    The horse that comes from the road,<br>   
    The rider, the birds that range <br>  
    From cloud to tumbling cloud,<br>   
    Minute by minute they change; <br>  
    A shadow of cloud on the stream  <br> 
    Changes minute by minute;   <br>
    A horse-hoof slides on the brim, <br>  
    And a horse plashes within it; <br>  
    The long-legged moor-hens dive, <br>  
    And hens to moor-cocks call; <br>  
    Minute by minute they live: <br>  
    The stone's in the midst of all.</p>
    
    <p>Too long a sacrifice<br>
    Can make a stone of the heart.<br>   
    O when may it suffice?<br>
    That is Heaven's part, our part <br>  
    To murmur name upon name, <br>  
    As a mother names her child<br>   
    When sleep at last has come<br>   
    On limbs that had run wild.<br>   
    What is it but nightfall?<br>
    No, no, not night but death; <br>  
    Was it needless death after all?<br>
    For England may keep faith  <br> 
    For all that is done and said. <br>  
    We know their dream; enough<br>
    To know they dreamed and are dead;<br>   
    And what if excess of love  <br> 
    Bewildered them till they died? <br>  
    I write it out in a verse—<br>
    MacDonagh and MacBride  <br> 
    And Connolly and Pearse<br>
    Now and in time to be,<br>
    Wherever green is worn,<br>
    Are changed, changed utterly:<br>   
    A terrible beauty is born.
